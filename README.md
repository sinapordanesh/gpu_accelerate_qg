# A GPU-Accelerated code for Quasi-Geostrophic simulaiton 

Adoptation from original numerical solver in MATLAB, to C++ code, accelerated by GPU via CUDA. 
The acceleration methodology follows the proposed method in [A GPU-accelerated simulation of rapid intensification of a tropical cyclone with observed heating](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08157)
